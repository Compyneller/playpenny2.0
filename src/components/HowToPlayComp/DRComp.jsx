      <h5>What is Deals Rummy?</h5>
      <p>
        Deals Rummy is another exciting variant of Rummy where the number of
        deals (game rounds) is preset at the beginning. The player with the

        game. It is preferred by both the veterans and novices alike because of
        its exciting game-play. After the number of deals has been pre-decided,

        table. Players have to bring minimum cash to the table. Two or more pack
        of cards will be used. Each pack has 53 cards including a printed joker.{" "}

      <h5>How the winners are determined in Deals Rummy?</h5>
      <p>
        The winner of each round earns the chips from the losers. <br />
        <br />
        The Player who has the maximum number of chips at the end of the
        pre-decided number of deals (2 or 6) becomes the winner. At the end of
        the pre-decided number of deals, players will be assigned ranks in the
        order of their chip count. <br />
        <br />
        Eg: Let us assume 6 players play in a 6-player table, Each player starts
        the game with 480 Points. Let us assume at the end of the first deal
        Player 4 declares and the remaining players have garnered 60, 50, 40,
        30, 20 points respectively, then the player 4 earns (60+50+40+30+20) 200
        points. His score would now be 680 (480+200). He would move into the
        second deal with 680 Points. At the same time, the other players’ will
        go in to the next round losing these chips. Player with the maximum
        number of chips at the end of 6-deals will win the game. <br />
        <br />
        If there is a tie-breaker, players with equal chip count would play
        between them to decide a winner.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5>How the Winning Amount is calculated in Deals Rummy?</h5>
      <p>
        Winner Earnings can be calculated as follows <br />
        <br />
        Winning Amount = Total entry fee of all Players – PlayPenny fees <br />
        <br />
        Example: In a 2-player deal game on Rs. 500 Table, if player 1 wins the
        game then he will receive Rs. 1000 – PlayPenny Service Fee. <br />
        <br />
        However, in a 6 deal rummy card game, prize amount after the deduction
        of the rake fee will be splitted in the ratio 60:40 between the winner
        and the runner-up. If 300 remains as the prize amount after the rake
        reduction, then winner gets Rs. (300*60/100) =180 and the runner-up
        would take home Rs. (300-180) =Rs. 120.
