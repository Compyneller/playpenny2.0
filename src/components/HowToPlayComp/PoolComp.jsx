      <h5>What is Pool Rummy?</h5>
      <p>
        Pool rummy is yet another exciting variant of online rummy. It is also
        known as the syndicate. Unlike Points Rummy and Deals Rummy, this rummy
        variant is exhaustive and takes considerable amount of time to complete.
        There are two variants of Pool Rummy – 101 Points Pool and 201 Points
        Pool. Players are eliminated once their accumulated scores reach the
        maximum points limit on the respective table – be it 101 Points Pool or
        201 Points Pool. The player who manages to keep his points within the
        point limits (101 or 201 depending on the table he plays) wins the game.
        Upto 6 players can play pool rummy in our tables.
        <br />
        Players have to pay a fixed entry fee to participate in this game.
        Unlike deals rummy, where you get to play with a fixed number of deals,
        there are no limits when it comes to the number of deals. Two to six
        players can play pool rummy. Two or more deck of cards would be used.

      <h5>How the winners are determined in Pool Rummy?</h5>
      <p>
        101 points pool Players will be eliminated once they reach or exceed the
        maximum limit defined i.e 101 Points in this case. So in such cases,
        Participant who has the lowest number of points when all of the
        participants touch 101 points would be the winner.
        <br />
        <br />
        Eg: In a 101 pool rummy game, if a player loses with 75 points at the
        end of first round, his points get carried over to the next round. The
        player then starts Round 2 with 75 points in hand; if the same player
        loses again with 30 points, his score now becomes (75 + 30 = 105), which
        his greater than 101, so the player gets eliminated.
        <br />
        <br />
        In a 201 pool rummy game, Players are eliminated when they reach or
        exceed the maximum limit defined (201 points this case).
        <br />
        <br />
        Eg: If a player loses with 80, 80, 50 points respectively in successive
        deals then his resultant score would be 210 (80+80+50) which is greater
        than 201, so he will be eliminated.
      </p>
      <br />
