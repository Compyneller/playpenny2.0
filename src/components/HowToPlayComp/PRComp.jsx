      <h5>What is Points Rummy?</h5>
      <p>
        Points Rummy is the fastest form of Indian Rummy and is also the most
        preferred variant among rummy enthusiasts because of its quick gameplay.
        It offers a good chance to win lots of money. Points rummy games are
        those rummy Games in which the monetary value associated with each point
        is preset at the beginning. The player who finishes first has their
        winning amount calculated as; (sum of points of all opponents) x
        (monetary value of 1 point). <br />
        <br />
        Points Rummy can be played with 2 to 6 players at PlayPenny. It is
        usually played with one or two packs of standard 52 deck card in
        addition to a printed joker. The variant is mostly preferred because of
        its quick gameplay. Unlike the other variants you do not have to go
        through multiple deals in order to win the game. Every game under points
        rummy has only a single deal. You can walk out of the game after its
        completion anytime. Players have to pay an entry fee to participate
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5>Points Rummy – The Objective</h5>
      <p>
        Points Rummy Rules are simple. Players need to make at least two
        sequences, one of which has to be a pure sequence and should arrange the
        remaining cards in sequences or set. Once the player completes the
        objective, he/she needs to discard one of the cards in the finish slot
        and declare the cards. If all the cards are grouped as mentioned above,
        he/she will win the game with zero points.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Points Rummy Rules</b>
      </p>
      <li>
        The game is played with a minimum of two decks. Each deck has 52 cards
        and a printed joker.
      </li>
      <li>
        A toss decides the player that makes the first move. The player who has
        the highest face value card gets the first turn to play.
      </li>
      <li>All players are dealt 13 cards randomly.</li>
      <li>
        A random joker is drawn after the distribution of cards, which can be
        used in place of a missing card while making sets and/or sequences. If
        the random card turns to be the printed joker then ace card belonging to
        any suit can be used as joker
      </li>
      <li>
        To indicate the start of the game, a card is drawn and kept in the open
        deck from which the first player can start with the game.
      </li>
      <br />
      <h5>How to play Points Rummy?</h5>
      <li>
        After logging in players can choose 13 Card Points Rummy section under
        the Cash Tab, where the ongoing games are displayed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Players can join any game listed based on their choice of entry fee and
        point value which would be mentioned. Every table has a certain point
        value and an entry fee to participate.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Player can join the game by clicking the “join” button and then
        should click “Join table” in the pop-up that appears. After that the
        players will be leaded to the table where he can chose his position by
        choosing “Sit Here”.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the 13 cards are dealt, the player can sort his cards using the
        sort feature which we have implemented in our tables to sort the cards
        based on suits for his convenience
      </li>
      <li>
        A player can pick a card from the open deck or the closed deck whenever
        his turn comes and he has to discard a card on the open deck also known
        as discard pile.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the first open card happens to be the joker, the player who plays the
        first turn is allowed to use the card and make his move. During the
        subsequent turns if the opponent discards a joker card, then the player
        cannot pick that card.
      </li>
      <li>
        Player has to make his move within the allocated time. If he fails to
        make his move, this will constitute as a missed move. After the player
        misses 3 consecutive moves, he/she will be dropped the game under middle
        drop rule and he will be out of the game with 40 Points. If the player
        is unsatisfied with his starting hands, then he/she can drop out of the
        game before making a move during his turn, then he will lose with 20
        points in what is known as the first drop.
      </li>
      <li>
        If all the cards from the closed deck are used, then the cards from the
        open deck are reshuffled and arranged as closed deck except a single
        card which will constitute as the first card of the open deck.
      </li>
      <li>
        The game-play continues until one player completes the objective of
        melding 13 cards into proper sets or sequences. After the player
        completes the objective, he should place his final discard in the finish
        slots, group the cards and click on declare. On a successful declare,
        the player will win with 0 Points.
      </li>
      <br />
      <h5>How the Winning Amount is calculated?</h5>
      <p>
        One winner wins the entire cash at the completion of every Points Rummy
        game. Winnings are calculated with this simple formula: <br />
        <br />
        Winning Amount = (Sum of points of all opponents) X (Rupee-value of the
        point) – DeccanRummy Fees
        <br />
        <br />
        Eg: If 6 players play 3 point rummy and 5 players lose with 50, 30, 20,
        20, 10 points then the winner takes 3*(50+30+20+20+10)= Rs 390 minus our
        service fee.
