            Indian rummy players have to pay 30% TDS on any winning above Rs
            10,000 in compliance with the Section 115BB and Section 194B of the
            Income Tax Act. Hence the TDS amount shall be deducted from the
            prizes given away for all the leaderboard contests and instances
            where the prize amount is more than Rs. 10000.
          </li>
          <li>
            The prize amounts secured in the weekly leaderboards every week will
            be deducted from the final prize offered for any contests whose
            standings are determined by players' performance in the weekly
            leaderboard contest.
          </li>
          <li>
            For example, if a player wins the weekly leaderboard 5 times, and
            secures a position in a contest (where standings are determined by
            player's performance in the weekly leaderboard contest), then the
            prize amount or gifts reserved for that position will be given after
            deducting the total prize amount given away in these 5 weeks.
          </li>

          purpose. Chip dumping is considered illegal by all the rummy online
